## Key Decisions

### v1 is cloud-based (not local-first)

- **Supabase Postgres** is the event store (not per-device SQLite)
- **Supabase Storage** (S3-compatible) for media (not BYO S3 — that's backlog)
- **Online required** — no offline support in v1
- **Supabase Edge Functions** for the WhatsApp bot webhook handler
- Local-first/offline with SQLite is deferred to a future version

### Backlog items (not v1 scope)

- BYO S3-compatible storage (any provider, not just Supabase)
- Local-first / offline mode with per-device SQLite
- Enrichment metadata as sidecar files in S3 (post-prototype idea)
